### Sandstorm_Synthesizer

Uses the Karplus-Strong algorithm to synthesize and play the chorus to the song "Sandstorm" by Darude.


Can be generalized to play any simple song by writing a string of 1/16th notes, using uppercase letters to represent each note and dashes to represent rests.

For example, "Sandstorm" uses the following string:
	"BBBBB-BBBBBBB-EEEEEEE-DDDDDDD-AABBBBB-BBBBBBB-EEBBBBB-BBBBBBB---"
